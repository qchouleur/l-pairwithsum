##Step 1

Given a collection of integers ordered ascendently and a sum. You must develop a method that will tell its
users wether a pair of integers from the collection sum matches the given one. The method complexity should
be as minimal as possible.

examples :

1.      numbers: [1, 2, 3, 9]  sum: 8
        expected output : false

2.      numbers: [-1, 2, 4, 4]  sum: 8
        expected output : true

##Step 2

The given collection is no longer sorted.
